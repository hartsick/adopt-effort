        %h1 Adopt an Effort!

        %h3 Hi. My name is Effort, and I'm a 2 year 10 month old male greyhound looking for a home!

        .description
          %p Up until this last October, I lived at the Caliente racetrack outside of Tijuana, but thanks to Fast Friends I've settled into home life just fine. I found a couch, and it was love at first sight!

          %p I do well with other dogs, even the small white ones, but can't be trusted around cats or other small, fuzzy animals. I love walks, and will fit myself into even the tiniest space if it means getting to cuddle with my family. I think I like to play, but I'm still learning what that means, and I'll do anything for a treat.

          %p The photos of me below were taken by my foster family, who are leaving from LA in March and would love to find a forever home for me before they leave.
